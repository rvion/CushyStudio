🖥️ **Cushy Studio**: A modern and cross-platform software to **Play** and **Work** with Generative AI Art. Explore and build generative Apps. **🌠 Image**, **🎥 Video**, and **🧊 3d**. Welcome to the future.

💎 **Cushy Apps**: Self-contained, use-case-centric applications with dedicated UIs that make generative art simple for everyone. Find the app for you need in the **Cushy Library**, from general-purpose Apps to very specific ones for dedicated use cases.

🚀 **Cushy SDK**: Automate your work or tackle specific use cases by building your own **App**. CushyStudio is packed with power-user tools to support you in building the "app" of your dreams. Once ready, share it with the world through the cushy app library.

☀️ **Cushy Cloud**: A cloud GPU renting service is launching soon so you can play with any demanding app, even on mobile devices. Fair prices to fund the CushyStudio growth, and grow the community. Growing the community includes revenue sharing with app creators when users rent GPU to use their app.

🎓 **Cushy Foundation**: Cushy is made to last. Free and Open source. It builds on proven technologies like [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI#readme), [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models), [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg#readme), or [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick). It features an extensible core and a professional UI with dockable panes. It is LLM-friendly. The project is early, but I'm (rvion) committed to growing this.

Art blooms in bytes, vast,
In Cushy realms, ideas soar,
For all, art awakes.
