- later: add a second smart backdrop capable of not covering anchor
- soon: refactor showTriggers
- add better presets
- clarify showBackdrop/hasBackdrop (is pretty clear, but usage is not great)
- make it possible for reveal to reveal nothing (not an empty component) and bypass makeTooltip / portal logic
