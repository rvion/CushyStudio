# ✨ Our Features

\##A broad overview of the features Cushy has, with embedded links to relevant sections with more information about each feature. (EG: Brief overview of Inpainting with a small screenshot(maybe), include a link to the Doc page that has a full overview of Inpainting.)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**GitBook tip:** A succinct video overview is a great way to introduce folks to your product. Embed a Loom, Vimeo or YouTube video and you're good to go! We love this video from the fine folks at Loom as a perfect example of a succinct feature overview.
