# 👋 Getting Started

\##This page will contain a brief introduction, a warning that the software is a beta and to expect many changes over time. We will also explain to the user that the documentation will match feature parity with Cushy and link to the current changelog. _(Maybe this page also will mention the latest features and link directly to the pages about them? TBD)_

{% hint style="info" %}
**GitBook tip:** your product docs aren't just a reference of all your features! use them to encourage folks to perform certain actions and discover the value in your product.

## Overview

Here are a couple of example overviews from products with really great docs:
