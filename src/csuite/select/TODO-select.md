TODO:

-   [ðŸŸ¢] 2024-07-24: fix select many (behave like a single select)
-   [ðŸŸ¢] 2024-07-24: pressing a letter to open the select do not properly insert the letter in the input
-   [ðŸ”¶ domi: LGTM?] 2024-07-24: pressing esc doesn't properly put focus back to the select =>
-   [ ] 2024-07-25: selecting a value reset the popup position => makes it super-hard to select values down the list.
        => domi: both virtualized and non-virtualized lists are affected.
        => domi: if SelectPopupUI is placed in anchor instead of reveal, no more issue.
        => domi: prob due to revealSt.contentFn = ... being re-set on every render.
        => btw do we expect RevealUI to be re-render when some random nested props of content change ? (via content + children)
-   [ ] 2024-07-24: built-in nullability (no more boolean before the value)
-   [ ] hovering the select anchor is applying hover effect on the popup, it should not
-   [ ] adding enough items to cause the select to wrap is not properly updating the associated reveal position => it should go down a bit
-   [ ] single select: picking an item shouldn't close the popup => the MOUSE UP should. otherwise, drag & slide is broken
-   [ðŸŸ¢] put back the old select anchor code (using grid layout to avoid icons to be stretched)
-   [ ] reveal not hidden when clicking outside of the popup
-   [ ] escape closes even when hide trigger escapeKey = false
-   [ ] make sure csuite.border is dynamically applied (why wouldn't it be ? observability bug ?)
