rvion: I'm using unique emojis as pins to related areas I want to be able to quickly jump to later.
this file list all registered unique emojis so I don't re-use them

- 🛝: added when converting gallery state to per-panel; fixing everything was annoying, so I commented a bunch of stuff and left 🛝

- 🏑: added around place that attempt to fix `cmd+w` closing electron when run in `IFrames`. super annoying bug.

- 🈲: added around places that need revisiting when Field Widgets are rewriten using shells with slots

- 🉑: Frame => Props
