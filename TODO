SHORT TERM TODO:

    ☐ remove all `p: {}` and other `: {}` annotations
    CORE BUGS:
        ☐ undoing choices via the undo button doesn't work properly. choices no longer there are still displayed
            ☐  absolutely need to write some failing test first; clearly some reactivity issue

        ☐ resetting lists kina make some lists not set (see controlnets)

    ☐ UC 2024-10-18
        ☐ reading the code
        ☐ making implementation plan
            ☐

    ✔ remove unoCSS @done(24-10-18 19:57)

    ☐ remove last remnants of daisy
        ☐ loading loading-spinner
        ☐ btn
        ☐ material-symbols-outlined

    ☐ fix the seed widget: right now, when in random mode (not set to a specific number) evaluating two prompts will use the same seed. it's a bug

    ☐ add missing observers (e.g. look for `UI = (p` )

    ☐ improve the civitai custom frontend:
        ☐ cache request
        ☐ add history
        ☐ download button has weird double spinner / double text while downloading

    ☐ prompts boxs are synced between two drafts this should not happen (have not checked other ui, vinsi pony app has this problem)
        ☐ find simple repro

    ☐ prompt plugins issues
        ☐ like the `preview final prompt` are not synced with the text. once opened, the text is never updated
        ☐ in the `lora plugin`: the first letter break focus, and then it allows you to type properly

    ☐ the generated prompt is just broken. (foo, bar, baz :1.1) generates shitty stuff.
        ☐ write test before fixing so those kind of stuff are never broken anymore

    ☐ gallery is broken with images incorrectly overlapping

    ☐ a draft is only synced when its duplicated, if you make a new item in a list after the duplication that item isn't synced

    ✔ gallery no longer resize dynamically; observability issues again @done(24-10-18 09:20)

    ✔ open in vscode enty in field menu not working @done(24-10-18 16:20)
    ✔ add menu entry to open step panel from any image that comes from a step @done(24-10-18 16:20)

    ☐ fix dropping images from gallery to mask

    ☐ add autofocus to image picker from inputImage

    ☐ opening minipaint says Cannot GET /minipaint/index.html
        ☐ prod don't work, dev does (tought my shortcut was dev.....)
        ☐ need to remove the three different public server, and just serve everything from root folder instead
        ☐ public folders were a bad idea



Nice to have?:
    ☐ Can step output be chosen what can be turned off and on? like only image on or only graphs?
        ☐ have toogles to allow to hide some of the outputs ?

    ☐ make a proper controlnet UI
